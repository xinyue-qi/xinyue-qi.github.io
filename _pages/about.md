I am a Principal Biostatistician at [Incyte Coporation](https://www.incyte.com/).

Prior to joining Incyte, I was a graduate research assistant at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and recevived my doctoral degree 
  in Biostatistics at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston under the supervision of 
[Dr. Shouhao Zhou](https://cancer.psu.edu/researchers) in the Department of Public Health Sciences at Penn State College of Medicine  and Dr. Christine B. Peterson in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. I graduated from School of Medicine at Duke University with a masterâ€™s degree in Biostatistics in 2017 and from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champian with a bachelor's degree in Molecular and Cellular Biology in 2015.

My research interests span the topics of Bayesian modeling and analysis for censored data, Meta-analysis, statistical applications to cancer immunotherapy and hematology studies.
