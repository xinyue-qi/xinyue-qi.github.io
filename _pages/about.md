I am a Principal Biostatistician at [Incyte Corporation](https://www.incyte.com/).

Prior to joining Incyte, I was a graduate research assistant at [the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center](https://www.mdanderson.org/) and received my doctoral degree in Biostatistics at [the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston](https://www.uth.edu/) under the supervision of 
[Dr. Shouhao Zhou](https://sites.psu.edu/szhou/) in the Department of Public Health Sciences at Penn State College of Medicine  and [Dr. Christine B. Peterson](https://odin.mdacc.tmc.edu/~cbpeterson/) in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. I graduated from School of Medicine at [Duke University](https://duke.edu/) with a *masterâ€™s* degree in Biostatistics in 2017 and [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) with a *bachelor's* degree in Molecular and Cellular Biology in 2015.

My research interests span the topics of Bayesian modeling for censored data, meta-analysis, with applications to cancer immunotherapy and hematology studies. To know about my research, please see recent publications on the personal [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C8&q=xinyue+qi&oq=) page.
