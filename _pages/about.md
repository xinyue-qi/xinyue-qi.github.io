I am a Principal Biostatistician at [Incyte Coporation](https://www.incyte.com/).

Prior to joining Incyte, I was a graduate research assistant and recevived my doctoral degree in Biostatistics under the supervisio of [Dr. Shouaho Zhou] (https://cancer.psu.edu/researchers/individual/-/researcher/8BD247A26C38BD2CE053C90D1DACECEA/shouhao-zhou-phd) in the Department of Public Health Sciences at [Penn State College of Medicine] and [Dr. Christine B. Peterson] in the Department of Biostatistics at [the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center]. I graduated from School of Medicine at Duke University with a masterâ€™s degree in Biostatistics in 2017 and from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champian with a bachelor's degree in Molecular and Cellular Biology in 2015.

My research interests span the topics of Bayesian modeling and analysis for censored data, Meta-analysis, statistical applications to cancer immunotherapy and hematology studies.
